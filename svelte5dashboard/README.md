# Company dashboard

This is a simple dashboard for a company. It is built with SvelteKit and TailwindCSS /DaisyUI.
It is based on this awesome svelte 5 starter [https://github.com/szig83/sveltekit-starter-svelte5](https://github.com/szig83/sveltekit-starter-svelte5)
For backend example check [https://github.com/bayaderpack/bayaderv3backend](https://github.com/bayaderpack/bayaderv3backend)

## Getting started

To get started, you will need to have Bun installed on your machine.

To run the project, run the following command:

```bash
bun install
bun pm untrusted
bun pm trust --all
bun dev
```

This will start the development server.
